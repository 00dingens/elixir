Nothing interesting here yet. Try again later.

# Roadmap

* Improve constant lookup
* Add missing types (dict, string, regexp)
* Add true, false and conditionals
* Object instantiation and instance vars
* Allow methods to be private
* Allow classes to be reopened
* Basic inheritance
* Improve STDLIB
* Extending builtin types (like inheriting from Integer)
* Allow function declarations inside object but automatically wrap them into a module
* Add JIT on module compilation
